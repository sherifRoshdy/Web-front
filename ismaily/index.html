            <p class="lead"><b>ISMAILY club or ISMAILY Club for Sports</b> <br>-->The story of the establishment of the Ismaili club dates back to more than 90 years, specifically in 1920 when the idea of ​​establishing an Egyptian club in Ismailia appeared on the surface, but this idea did not see the light and appears on the ground until in 1921 when this club was built through self-help and through collecting donations from the people .
                The headquarters of this club was the place of the Friday market today and its name at that time was Al-Nahda Club and it was popularized in 1924 and then this club - Ismaili or Al-Nahda - became a member of the Egyptian Football Association in 1926.
                At the beginning of his reign, the club was very modest, as it was built with a mud-brick fence with one room for dressing and a soccer field, and the stadium was sandy and next to it a wooden stall with an area of ​​no more than four meters. In 1931 the wooden kiosk was removed and the land was cultivated with vetiver and a modest building containing two rooms was created, but this building was not suitable in Ismailia, so the people joined forces to create a new headquarters
                The club is fit for Ismailia, and this was achieved in 1943, and the club acquired a piece of land with an area of ​​about 15 thousand meters. The club moved to its new headquarters, which is the youth care building currently, and Ismaili was the first Egyptian club in Ismailia where all the clubs at that time were affiliated with foreign communities in Ismailia And the channel area
