                    <p class="card-text">Smouha Club was founded in 1949, the name of this club was due to its establishment in the Smouha neighborhood of Alexandria and because the first club presidents in its history are called Joseph Smouha. Engineer Faraj Amer has headed the Smouha Club since 1998 until now, but as for the club's last elections, it was in 2010 and the presidency has not changed.
                            He was sacked in November because of poor results and Hamza al-Jamal replaced him. Despite the improvement of the team's results, the team's continued threat of relegation to the second degree pushed the board of directors to dismiss the sentences and assign Mimi Abdel Razek to his place in May 2011. The team ended up in the penultimate position, the center that goes down its owner to the second degree. However, the Football Association canceled the decline in this season to save the team from returning to the second degree.

                    <p class="card-text">The 2010-2011 season became the first season for Smouha in his history in the Premier League. In preparation for this, Smouha dismissed his coach, Mushir Othman, and appointed the former coach of the Egyptian team, Mohsen Saleh, as his replacement. It also included a number of experienced players, including former international defender Bashir Al-Tabei, and the league's top scorer for the 2002-2003 season, Ahmed Bilal. After the opening match, which the team lost to military production, without a goal, Mohsen Saleh resigned due to the inability to coordinate his time with his work as a game analyst on Egyptian TV. He was succeeded by French coach Patrice Nouveau in August 2010. Nouveau did not last long with the team
                         The skillful midfield Mahmoud Abdel Hakim and defensive midfielder Ayman Saeed and Ilyasu Isiaka. The team presented a strong season and almost secured a place in the league's specific quadruple, but it tied in its last game against Wadi Degla Club to qualify for Enppi instead. The contest was suspended in any case after the military coup, for security reasons.
